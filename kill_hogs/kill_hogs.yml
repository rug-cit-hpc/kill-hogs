    Dear cluster user,

    We detected resource intensive processes on the login node running from your account.
    The login node of the cluster is used by all users of the cluster to login and submit jobs. A high load on the login node will impair the usability of the cluster for other users.
    It is therefore not allowed to run processes that take a significant amount of memory or cpu power. We have a short queue available if you quickly want to test something. Alternatively you could use the interactive node which has less severe restrictions.

      Dear cluster user,

      We detected resource intensive processes on the interactive node running from your account.
      Your processes were killed upon a request by another user.
      The interactive node is meant for more heavy processes but it should still be available to other users.
